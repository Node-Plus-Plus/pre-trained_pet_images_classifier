# pre-trained_pet_images_classifier
This is an AI project used to classify the passed animal image weather it's dog image or not , if it's a dog image , The classifier will determine it's breed

This project is written by python using Pytorch library 
it can use one of the three CNN architecture model (VGG, Alexnet, Resnet),
but after tests we picked (VGG) architecture as default.

the classifier can determine if the image is-of-a dog or not ,
if so it can determine it's breed by correctness percentage of 100%.

we have appended the pet_images folder that contains sample images for test

# How to use 
Add the images that you want to classify to "uploaded_images" folder 
but take care about the image name syntax
it must follow this format (Image_Name_0034.jpg) replace the white spaces with (_)"underscores"
also the image must be in "jpg" format , 
it should be approximately square in shape.

That's all
